# java-calculator
A beginner Java calculator project written in Intellij IDEA


This is a simple console-based calculator written in Java. It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus — all in a loop, until the user decides to exit.

## ✨ Features

- Perform operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Continues running until the user enters `x` or `X`
- Input taken from user at runtime
- Clean and readable code with basic error handling

## 🧠 Why I Built This

This project was created to practice and strengthen my understanding of basic Java programming concepts like conditionals, loops, and user input. Building a calculator is a classic beginner project that helped me apply core logic in a hands-on way.

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jhanvibhat2611/java-calculator.git
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE).
3. Navigate to the file: `Calculator.java`.
4. Run the program.
5. Follow the instructions in the terminal to perform calculations.

## 📚 Concepts Used

- Java packages
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditionals (`if`/`else`)
- Taking input with `Scanner`
- Character handling with `charAt(0)` and `.trim()`

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add input validation for non-numeric values
- Handle division by zero explicitly
- Extend functionality (e.g., power, square root)
- Create a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing
